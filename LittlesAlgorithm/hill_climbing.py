# Hill-climbing method: 

# 1. Make a random matrix
# 2. Calculate the shortest tour & measure and save the run-tume of Little's algorithm
# 3. Mutate the matrix (change a single number)
# 4. Calculate the shortest tour & measure the run-time of Little's algorithm
# 5. 
# (a) If the new run time > old run time, go to #3
# (b) If the new run time <= old run time, revert to the older matrix, then go to #3
